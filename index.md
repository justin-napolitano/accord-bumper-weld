# JB Welding My Accord Bumper

## Motivation

I recently found myself with a bumper on my Honda Accord that was barely hanging on — literally held by a piece of rebar after a parking lot mishap. Bumpers are expensive to replace or paint, running me around $400 if I tried to do it myself, and even more if I took it to a shop. So instead of shelling out big bucks or ending up with a car that looks like a beater, I decided to try a quick, functional fix using JB Weld.

## The Problem

The bumper had two main issues: on one side, the plastic around the screw holding the bumper to the bracket cracked, and on the other, the bracket that attaches to the impact bar snapped clean off. Both needed some kind of repair to keep the bumper attached, at least temporarily.

## How I Built It

I kept things simple. I didn’t want to make the prettiest or strongest repair — just something functional enough to hold the bumper in place until I decide to replace it properly (if ever).

The tools were minimal: a razor blade, a flat head screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver — the usual suspects in my pockets. For the adhesive, I chose a version of JB Weld that was inexpensive and matched the color of my car fairly well. I linked to the exact product I used in my notes.

I started on the easier side, where the attachment point was broken but still fixable. The goal was just to hold the bumper to the mounting screw securely enough to prevent it from falling off.

## Interesting Implementation Details

- I chose JB Weld because it’s a strong, reinforced epoxy that can bond plastic parts effectively, and it was cost-effective.
- Instead of trying to perfectly restore the bumper’s strength, I focused on functionality and ease of future replacement.
- Documenting the process with photos and notes helped me keep track of what I did and could help others facing similar issues.

## Why this project matters for my career

This project is a reminder that problem-solving doesn’t always require complex code or software. Sometimes, it’s about applying practical skills and resourcefulness to real-world problems. Documenting this process improves my ability to communicate technical details clearly, a crucial skill in any development or engineering role. Plus, it shows my willingness to tackle challenges hands-on and learn from every experience, no matter how small or unrelated to coding it may seem.
