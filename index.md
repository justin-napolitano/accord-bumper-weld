# JB Welding My Accord Bumper: Technical Documentation

## Motivation

The project addresses a practical problem: repairing a damaged Honda Accord bumper without incurring high costs associated with replacement or professional repair. Bumpers and their paint jobs can be expensive, with estimates around $400 for parts and paint. The goal is to create a functional, if not aesthetically perfect, repair that maintains the bumper's attachment and usability.

## Problem Statement

The bumper was severely damaged, hanging precariously by a piece of rebar after a reverse collision. Two main issues were identified:

- On one side, the plastic around the screw attaching the bumper to the bracket cracked.
- On the other side, the bracket that connects to the impact bar snapped off completely.

The challenge was to secure the bumper sufficiently to avoid immediate replacement, using minimal tools and inexpensive materials.

## Approach and Implementation

The repair uses JB Weld, a two-part epoxy adhesive known for strong bonding and heat resistance. The choice was driven by cost-effectiveness and a color match to the car.

Tools required were minimal: a razor blade, flat head screwdriver, and Phillips screwdriver—items commonly carried.

The repair focused on the easier side first, where the broken attachment point could be temporarily fixed to hold the bumper until a full replacement might be feasible. The objective was not to restore original strength but to provide a functional hold.

## Technical Details

- JB Weld was applied to bond broken plastic parts and brackets.
- The repair prioritized mechanical stability over aesthetics.
- The project documentation includes step-by-step notes and photos to track the repair process.

## Practical Considerations

- The repair is a stopgap measure, acknowledging the bumper will likely need replacement eventually.
- The use of JB Weld avoids the need for specialized welding equipment or professional bodywork.
- Minimal tools and materials keep the repair accessible.

## Summary

This project exemplifies a pragmatic approach to automotive repair, leveraging inexpensive materials and straightforward techniques to extend the life of a damaged component. The documentation serves as a reference for similar repairs and a record of the methodology applied.
