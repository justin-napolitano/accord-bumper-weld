This repo details my DIY project for repairing a Honda Accord bumper with JB Weld adhesive. It serves as a hands-on guide, complete with notes and photos showing the repair process.

## Key Features

- Step-by-step repair documentation
- Affordable JB Weld as the adhesive
- Photo archive capturing essential stages

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for the documentation
- Simple static site structure

## Getting Started

To dive in:

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/accord-bumper-weld.git
    ```

2. Open `index.md` in any Markdown viewer.

3. Check out the `photos` folder for visuals.

## Project Structure

```
accord-bumper-weld/
├── index.md      # Main guide
└── photos/       # Repair process images
```

### Gotcha

This is purely an archive, not executable code. Future enhancements may include more detailed media and a complete parts list.
